<h1>HellerUI Design System Environment Setup</h1>

---

## Getting Started 

- `git clone https://github.com/nicholasgalante1997/HellerUI` 
- `git checkout development` **Note** there's no -b flag
- `git pull origin development`

## Basics and Env 

this package uses npm for its package management, I'd highly encourage also using npm over yarn in this particular circumstance for certain version dependency ease cases.

In the root directory, `npm install` 

This is not a Create React App generated react app.
This is a node initiated package. You'll notice some differences right away for what that means for project structure.
Here is a 10,000 foot overview, top down

### __mocks__
- Will rarely ever need to adjust this file in this dir, skip it for dev work

### .changeset
- This one is *important* to understand
- We use changesets as our version management library of choice
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changesets/cli 
    - I highly recommend reading through these docs, it would overall take you 45 seconds.
    - If someone besides Storybook can make a compelling case for the transition to Auto for version management msg me,
    otherwise we will keep on with changesets until its deprecated or it kills us.
- Understanding this folder,
    - You will not need to change config.json
    - In fact you'll never write to this folder at all,
    - This folder contains auto generated files pertaining to differences in releases that our github workflow will use to sync npm to our master branch.
    - For a better overall understanding, see <b style={{color: 'blue'}}>How Publishing Works</b>

### .github 

- Currently this maintains our workflows dir, which contains gh workflows for releasing new version updates to npm.
- There are other workflows I think would be beneficial to institute, like integration test actions.
- Workflows are written in YAML baby! Fucking love Yaml. Familiarize yourself with its syntax here: [Yaml](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started)
- How our Release wflow works: 
    - On pushes to master
        - Checkout master
        - Set up Node 14.x environment runtimes
        - Set up internal package dependencies
        - Changesets Publish
            - 2 things could happen from here 
                - If this is the initial push to master, changesets kicks off a PR to merge into master containing version specific differences for review and automatically updates the semver number.
                - If this wflow is kicked off due to the merging of an above instantiated PR, we bundle with rollup and ship to npm 
        - Clean up any remaining jobs
        - Close dependencies

- I would like to setup automatic releases for updates of a static storybook cloud lib,
msg me if you'd like to spearhead that 

## .storybook  <= [THIS!]

Do you see that this is an h2 and all the other sections are h3s? That's how important this is.
This is the meat and potatoes of our project. We use storybook to handle our design system's infrastructure and story generation.
We have a mutual trust with storybook, that we will adhere to its docs, and it won't fuck us on future releases. 
As far as you're concerned, this is Jobu and you are Cerrano.

- main.js 
    - Responsible for handling 2 things
        - Where to look for the stories 
        - What addons we need for our project 

- preview-head.html 
    - If we need to load any cdns or google font preconnect links, it needs to be here. 
    - NOT FOR GLOBAL STYLES
    - NOT FOR GLOBAL STYLES
    - NOT A TYPO ^^ JUST DUMB IMPORTANT
    - NOT FOR GLOBAL STYLES AGAIN

- preview 
    - for our use case, the default config for this file works. AKA dont touch it with a 40 foot pole.
    - pretty please, not to be a dick.

- webpack.config.js 
    - config settings for how storybook bundles our stories and then represents it to us in its UI 

## SRC 

### /colors 

- WIP lib file for our multiple color themes;

### /components

- Where all of the components that we build will live.
- The naming convention here is /src/components/Component/
- with the name of the component capitalized as the dir name.
- each component dir will have 4 files until we can figure out how to add sass support.
    - Component.stories.tsx
    - Component.test.tsx
    - Component.tsx 
    - index.ts (entry point)
- See <b style={{color: 'blue'}}>Creating a Component</b> for more details on what goes into each of these files 

### /contexts 

- I think something super cool to do would be to use context to provide different themes 
- NOT an mvp goal currently
- may periodically launch tickets for contexts if new use cases arise 

### /dict 

- Any type declaration that will be used in more than 2 files, or more than 1 dir, please put the type into the /dict dir 
for common usage around the package.

### /docs 

- home to the internal storybook docs you're reading right now üòè 
- if you want to see live time edits, run `npm run storybook` and edit /src/docs/env-setup.stories.mdx 

## Man i forgot how much I hated reading
## TLDR, getting SB up 

after installing dependencies,
run `npm run storybook` to start the storybook GUI,
from here, you'll have access to all of the lib's documentation and components.
In the GUI you can interact with the visual states to test components with variable props 
to see how they hold up to edge cases. CTRL C in the terminal will end the running UI session.
