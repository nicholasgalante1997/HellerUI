"My name is Milo Minderbinder. I am twenty-seven years old."

Milo Minderbinder's planes flew in from everywhere, the pursuit planes,
bombers, and cargo ships streaming into Colonel Cathcart's field with pilots at
the controls who would do what they were told. The planes were decorated with
flamboyant squadron emblems illustrating such laudable ideals as Courage,
Might, Justice, Truth, Liberty, Love, Honor and Patriotism that were painted out
at once by Milo's mechanics with a double coat of flat white and replaced in
garish purple with the stenciled name M & M ENTERPRISES, FINE FRUITS
AND PRODUCE. The 'M & M' In 'M & M ENTERPRISES' stood for Milo &
Minderbinder, and the & was inserted, Milo revealed candidly, to nullify any
impression that the syndicate was a one-man operation. Planes arrived for Milo
from airfields in Italy, North Africa and England, and from Air Transport
Command stations in Liberia, Ascension Island, Cairo, and Karachi. Pursuit
planes were traded for additional cargo ships or retained for emergency invoice
duty and small-parcel service; trucks and tanks were procured from the ground
forces and used for short-distance road hauling. Everybody had a share, and men
got fat and moved about tamely with toothpicks in their greasy lips. Milo
supervised the whole expanding operation by himself. Deep otter-brown lines of
preoccupation etched themselves permanently into his careworn face and gave
him a harried look of sobriety and mistrust. Everybody but Yossarian thought
Milo was a jerk, first for volunteering for the job of mess officer and next for
taking it so seriously. Yossarian also thought that Milo was a jerk; but he also
knew that Milo was a genius.

One day Milo flew away to England to pick up a load of Turkish halvah and
came flying back from Madagascar leading four German bombers filled with
yams, collards, mustard greens and black-eyed Georgia peas. Milo was
dumbfounded when he stepped down to the ground and found a contingent of
armed M.P.s waiting to imprison the German pilots and confiscate their planes.
Confiscate! The mere word was anathema to him, and he stormed back and forth
in excoriating condemnation, shaking a piercing finger of rebuke in the guiltridden faces of Colonel Cathcart, Colonel Korn and the poor battle-scarred
captain with the submachine gun who commanded the M.P.s.

"Is this Russia?" Milo assailed them incredulously at the top of his voice.
"Confiscate?" he shrieked, as though he could not believe his own ears. "Since
when is it the policy of the American government to confiscate the private
property of its citizens? Shame on you! Shame on all of you for even thinking
such a horrible thought."

"But Milo," Major Danby interrupted timidly, "we're at war with Germany, and
those are German planes."

"They are no such thing!" Milo retorted furiously. "Those planes belong to the
syndicate, and everybody has a share. Confiscate? How can you possibly
confiscate your own private property? Confiscate, indeed! I've never heard
anything so depraved in my whole life."

And sure enough, Milo was right, for when they looked, his mechanics had
painted out the German swastikas on the wings, tails and fuselages with double
coats of flat white and stenciled in the words M & M ENTERPRISES, FINE
FRUITS AND PRODUCE. Right before their eyes he had transformed his
syndicate into an international cartel.

Milo's argosies of plenty now filled the air. Planes poured in from Norway,
Denmark, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
Sweden, Finland, Poland-from everywhere in Europe, in fact, but Russia, with
whom Milo refused to do business. When everybody who was going to had
signed up with M & M Enterprises, Fine Fruits and Produce, Milo created a
wholly owned subsidiary, M & M Fancy Pastry, and obtained more airplanes and
more money from the mess funds for scones and crumpets from the British Isles,
prune and cheese Danish from Copenhagen, éclairs, cream puffs, Napoleons and
petits fours from Paris, Reims and Grenoble, Kugelhopf, pumpernickel and
Pfefferkuchen from Berlin, Linzer and Dobos Torten from Vienna, Strudel from
Hungary and baklava from Ankara. Each morning Milo sent planes aloft all over
Europe and North Africa hauling long red tow signs advertising the day's
specials in large square letters: "EYEROUND, 79¢... WHITING, 21¢." He
boosted cash income for the syndicate by leasing tow signs to Pet Milk, Gaines
Dog Food, and Noxzema. In a spirit of civic enterprise, he regularly allotted a
certain amount of free aerial advertising space to General Peckem for the
propagation of such messages in the public interest as NEATNESS COUNTS,
HASTE MAKES WASTE, and THE FAMILY THAT PRAYS TOGETHER
STAYS TOGETHER. Milo purchased spot radio announcements on Axis Sally's
and Lord Haw Haw's daily propaganda broadcasts from Berlin to keep things
moving. Business boomed on every battlefront.

##### from chapter Milo The Mayor

But Orr was sleepy, too, and Yossarian and Orr were both at Milo's side when
they rode into the city of Palermo from the airport and discovered that there was
no room for the two of them at the hotel there either, and, more important, that
Milo was mayor.

The weird, implausible reception for Milo began at the airfield, where civilian
laborers who recognized him halted in their duties respectfully to gaze at him
with full expressions of controlled exuberance and adulation. News of his arrival
preceded him into the city, and the outskirts were already crowded with cheering
citizens as they sped by in their small uncovered truck. Yossarian and Orr were
mystified and mute and pressed close against Milo for security.

Inside the city, the welcome for Milo grew louder as the truck slowed and eased
deeper toward the middle of town. Small boys and girls had been released from
school and were lining the sidewalks in new clothes, waving tiny flags.
Yossarian and Orr were absolutely speechless now. The streets were jammed
with joyous throngs, and strung overhead were huge banners bearing Milo's
picture. Milo had posed for these pictures in a drab peasant's blouse with a high
collar, and his scrupulous, paternal countenance was tolerant, wise, critical and
strong as he stared out at the populace omnisciently with his undisciplined
mustache and disunited eyes. Sinking invalids blew kisses to him from windows.
Aproned shopkeepers cheered ecstatically from the narrow doorways of their
shops. Tubas crumped. Here and there a person fell and was trampled to death.
Sobbing old women swarmed through each other frantically around the slowmoving truck to touch Milo's shoulder or press his hand. Milo bore the
tumultuous celebrations with benevolent grace. He waved back to everyone in
elegant reciprocation and showered generous handfuls of foilcovered Hershey
kisses to the rejoicing multitudes. Lines of lusty young boys and girls skipped
along behind him with their arms linked, chanting in hoarse and glassy-eyed
adoration, "Milo! Mi-lo! Mi-lo!"

Now that his secret was out, Milo relaxed with Yossarian and Orr and inflated
opulently with a vast, shy pride. His cheeks turned flesh-colored. Milo had been
elected mayor of Palermo-and of nearby Carini, Monreale, Bagheria, Termini
Imerese, Cefalu, Mistretta and Nicosia as well-because he had brought Scotch to
Sicily.

Yossarian was amazed. "The people here like to drink Scotch that much?"

"They don't drink any of the Scotch," Milo explained. "Scotch is very expensive,
and these people here are very poor."

"Then why do you import it to Sicily if nobody drinks any?"

"To build up a price. I move the Scotch here from Malta to make more room for
profit when I sell it back to me for somebody else. I created a whole new
industry here. Today Sicily is the third largest exporter of Scotch in the world,
and that's why they elected me mayor."

"How about getting us a hotel room if you're such a hotshot?" Orr grumbled
impertinently in a voice slurred with fatigue.

Milo responded contritely. "That's just what I'm going to do," he promised. "I'm
really sorry about forgetting to radio ahead for hotel rooms for you two. Come
along to my office and I'll speak to my deputy mayor about it right now."

Milo's office was a barbershop, and his deputy mayor was a pudgy barber from
whose obsequious lips cordial greetings foamed as effusively as the lather he
began whipping up in Milo's shaving cup.

"Well, Vittorio," said Milo, settling back lazily in one of Vittorio's barber chairs,
"how were things in my absence this time?"

"Very sad, Signor Milo, very sad. But now that you are back, the people are all
happy again."

"I was wondering about the size of the crowds. How come all the hotels are
full?"

"Because so many people from other cities are here to see you, Signor Milo. And
because we have all the buyers who have come into town for the artichoke
auction."

Milo's hand soared up perpendicularly like an eagle and arrested Vittorio's
shaving brush. "What's artichoke?" he inquired.

"Artichoke, Signor Milo? An artichoke is a very tasty vegetable that is popular
everywhere. You must try some artichokes while you are here, Signor Milo. We
grow the best in the world."

"Really?" said Milo. "How much are artichokes selling for this year?"

"It looks like a very good year for artichokes. The crops were very bad."

"Is that a fact?" mused Milo, and was gone, sliding from his chair so swiftly that
his striped barber's apron retained his shape for a second or two after he had
gone before it collapsed. Milo had vanished from sight by the time Yossarian and
Orr rushed after him to the doorway.

"Next?" barked Milo's deputy mayor officiously. "Who's next?"

Yossarian and Orr walked from the barbershop in dejection. Deserted by Milo,
they trudged homelessly through the reveling masses in futile search of a place
to sleep. Yossarian was exhausted. His head throbbed with a dull, debilitating
pain, and he was irritable with Orr, who had found two crab apples somewhere
and walked with them in his cheeks until Yossarian spied them there and made
him take them out. Then Orr found two horse chestnuts somewhere and slipped
those in until Yossarian detected them and snapped at him again to take the crab
apples out of his mouth. Orr grinned and replied that they were not crab apples
but horse chestnuts and that they were not in his mouth but in his hands, but
Yossarian was not able to understand a single word he said because of the horse
chestnuts in his mouth and made him take them out anyway. A sly light twinkled
in Orr's eyes. He rubbed his forehead harshly with his knuckles, like a man in an
alcoholic stupor, and snickered lewdly.

"Do you remember that girl-" He broke off to snicker lewdly again. "Do you
remember that girl who was hitting me over the head with that shoe in that
apartment in Rome, when we were both naked?" he asked with a look of cunning
expectation. He waited until Yossarian nodded cautiously. "If you let me put the
chestnuts back in my mouth I'll tell you why she was hitting me. Is that a deal?"
Yossarian nodded, and Orr told him the whole fantastic story of why the naked
girl in Nately's whore's apartment was hitting him over the head with her shoe,
but Yossarian was not able to understand a single word because the horse
chestnuts were back in his mouth. Yossarian roared with exasperated laughter at
the trick, but in the end there was nothing for them to do when night fell but eat
a damp dinner in a dirty restaurant and hitch a ride back to the airfield, where
they slept on the chill metal floor of the plane and turned and tossed in groaning
torment until the truck drivers blasted up less than two hours later with their
crates of artichokes and chased them out onto the ground while they filled up the
plane. A heavy rain began falling. Yossarian and Orr were dripping wet by the
time the trucks drove away and had no choice but to squeeze themselves back
into the plane and roll themselves up like shivering anchovies between the
jolting corners of the crates of artichokes that Milo flew up to Naples at dawn
and exchanged for the cinnamon sticks, cloves, vanilla beans and pepper pods
that he rushed right back down south with that same day to Malta, where, it
turned out, he was Assistant Governor-General. There was no room for
Yossarian and Orr in Malta either. Milo was Major Sir Milo Minderbinder in
Malta and had a gigantic office in the governor-general's building. His
mahogany desk was immense. In a panel of the oak wall, between crossed
British flags, hung a dramatic arresting photograph of Major Sir Milo
Minderbinder in the dress uniform of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. His mustache in
the photograph was clipped and narrow, his chin was chiseled, and his eyes were
sharp as thorns. Milo had been knighted, commissioned a major in the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers and named Assistant Governor-General of Malta because he had
brought the egg trade there. He gave Yossarian and Orr generous permission to
spend the night on the thick carpet in his office, but shortly after he left a sentry
in battle dress appeared and drove them from the building at the tip of his
bayonet, and they rode out exhaustedly to the airport with a surly cab driver, who
overcharged them, and went to sleep inside the plane again, which was filled
now with leaking gunny sacks of cocoa and freshly ground coffee and reeking
with an odor so rich that they were both outside retching violently against the
landing gear when Milo was chauffeured up the first thing the next morning,
looking fit as a fiddle, and took right off for Oran, where there was again no
room at the hotel for Yossarian and Orr, and where Milo was Vice-Shah. Milo
had at his disposal sumptuous quarters inside a salmon-pink palace, but
Yossarian and Orr were not allowed to accompany him inside because they were
Christian infidels. They were stopped at the gates by gargantuan Berber guards
with scimitars and chased away. Orr was snuffling and sneezing with a crippling
head cold. Yossarian's broad back was bent and aching. He was ready to break
Milo's neck, but Milo was Vice-Shah of Oran and his person was sacred. Milo
was not only the Vice-Shah of Oran, as it turned out, but also the Caliph of
Baghdad, the Imam of Damascus, and the Sheik of Araby. Milo was the corn
god, the rain god and the rice god in backward regions where such crude gods
were still worshiped by ignorant and superstitious people, and deep inside the
jungles of Africa, he intimated with becoming modesty, large graven images of
his mustached face could be found overlooking primitive stone altars red with
human blood. Everywhere they touched he was acclaimed with honor, and it was
one triumphal ovation after another for him in city after city until they finally
doubled back through the Middle East and reached Cairo, where Milo cornered
the market on cotton that no one else in the world wanted and brought himself
promptly to the brink of ruin. In Cairo there was at last room at the hotel for
Yossarian and Orr. There were soft beds for them with fat fluffed-up pillows and
clean, crisp sheets. There were closets with hangers for their clothes. There was
water to wash with. Yossarian and Orr soaked their rancid, unfriendly bodies
pink in a steaming-hot tub and then went from the hotel with Milo to eat shrimp
cocktails and filet mignon in a very fine restaurant with a stock ticker in the
lobby that happened to be clicking out the latest quotation for Egyptian cotton
when Milo inquired of the captain of waiters what kind of machine it was. Milo
had never imagined a machine so beautiful as a stock ticker before.

"Really?" he exclaimed when the captain of waiters had finished his explanation.
"And how much is Egyptian cotton selling for?" The captain of waiters told him,
and Milo bought the whole crop.

But Yossarian was not nearly so frightened by the Egyptian cotton Milo bought
as he was by the bunches of green red bananas Milo had spotted in the native
market place as they drove into the city, and his fears proved justified, for Milo
shook him awake out of a deep sleep just after twelve and shoved a partly peeled
banana toward him. Yossarian choked back a sob.

"Taste it," Milo urged, following Yossarian's writhing face around with the
banana insistently.

"Milo, you bastard," moaned Yossarian, "I've got to get some sleep."

"Eat it and tell me if it's good," Milo persevered. "Don't tell Orr I gave it to you.
I charged him two piasters for his."

Yossarian ate the banana submissively and closed his eyes after telling Milo it
was good, but Milo shook him awake again and instructed him to get dressed as
quickly as he could, because they were leaving at once for Pianosa.

"You and Orr have to load the bananas into the plane right away," he explained.
"The man said to watch out for spiders while you're handling the bunches."

"Milo, can't we wait until morning?" Yossarian pleaded. "I've got to get some
sleep."

"They're ripening very quickly," answered Milo, "and we don't have a minute to
lose. Just think how happy the men back at the squadron will be when they get
these bananas."

But the men back at the squadron never even saw any of the bananas, for it was a
seller's market for bananas in Istanbul and a buyer's market in Beirut for the
caraway seeds Milo rushed with to Bengasi after selling the bananas, and when
they raced back into Pianosa breathlessly six days later at the conclusion of Orr's
rest leave, it was with a load of best white eggs from Sicily that Milo said were
from Egypt and sold to his mess halls for only four cents apiece so that all the
commanding officers in his syndicate would implore him to speed right back to
Cairo for more bunches of green red bananas to sell in Turkey for the caraway
seeds in demand in Bengasi. And everybody had a share.

Milo Minderbinder's planes flew in from everywhere, the pursuit planes,

the controls who would do what they were told. The planes were decorated with
flamboyant squadron emblems illustrating such laudable ideals as Courage,

when Milo inquired of the captain of waiters what kind of machine it was. Milo
had never imagined a machine so beautiful as a stock ticker before.

"Really?" he exclaimed when the captain of waiters had finished his explanation.
"And how much is Egyptian cotton selling for?" The captain of waiters told him,
and Milo bought the whole crop.

But Yossarian was not nearly so frightened by the Egyptian cotton Milo bought
as he was by the bunches of green red bananas Milo had spotted in the native
market place as they drove into the city, and his fears proved justified, for Milo
shook him awake out of a deep sleep just after twelve and shoved a partly peeled
banana toward him. Yossarian choked back a sob.

"Taste it," Milo urged, following Yossarian's writhing face around with the
banana insistently.

"Milo, you bastard," moaned Yossarian, "I've got to get some sleep."

"Eat it and tell me if it's good," Milo persevered. "Don't tell Orr I gave it to you.
I charged him two piasters for his."

Yossarian ate the banana submissively and closed his eyes after telling Milo it
was good, but Milo shook him awake again and instructed him to get dressed as
quickly as he could, because they were leaving at once for Pianosa.

"You and Orr have to load the bananas into the plane right away," he explained.
"The man said to watch out for spiders while you're handling the bunches."

"Milo, can't we wait until morning?" Yossarian pleaded. "I've got to get some
sleep."

"They're ripening very quickly," answered Milo, "and we don't have a minute to
lose. Just think how happy the men back at the squadron will be when they get
these bananas."

But the men back at the squadron never even saw any of the bananas, for it was a
seller's market for bananas in Istanbul and a buyer's market in Beirut for the
caraway seeds Milo rushed with to Bengasi after selling the bananas, and when
they raced back into Pianosa breathlessly six days later at the conclusion of Orr's
rest leave, it was with a load of best white eggs from Sicily that Milo said were
from Egypt and sold to his mess halls for only four cents apiece so that all the
commanding officers in his syndicate would implore him to speed right back to
Cairo for more bunches of green red bananas to sell in Turkey for the caraway
seeds in demand in Bengasi. And everybody had a share.
